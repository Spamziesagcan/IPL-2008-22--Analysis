### 🏏 IPL Match Data Analysis (2008-2022)
**ML | DS | Python**

#### 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **IPL match data from 2008 to 2022** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and advanced visualizations**. It uncovers insights about team performance, player efficiency, and match trends using **3D interactive plots, heatmaps, and statistical analysis**.

#### 🚀 Features & Insights
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created custom metrics for **batting, bowling, and clutch performance**.  
- **Data Visualization:** Used **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for **interactive 3D scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar charts**.  
- **Performance Trends:** Identified **top players, team win distributions, and over-wise scoring patterns**.  

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Machine Learning:** Feature Engineering & Statistical Analysis  

#### 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Total runs scored by each team (Bar Chart)**
- **Top 5 run-scorers (Pie Chart)**
- **Correlation heatmap of match stats**
- **Batsman performance (3D Scatter Plot)**
- **Team wins per season (3D Bubble Chart)**
- **Runs scored per over (3D Surface Plot)**  

#### 💾 Dataset
The dataset consists of IPL match statistics from 2008 to 2022. It includes columns such as **team names, runs, wickets, overs, players, and match outcomes**.

#### 🛠️ Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-analysis.git
   cd ipl-analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
